		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img src = "assets/images/photo.jpg">
		<p>I am a 28 year old male. Currently residing in California but I was born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States at the age of one in 1990. Upon finishing highechool I attended the University of Riverside, California under a biology major with plans to go pre-med to eventually be a forensic scientist. Eventually I had lost interest in becoming a doctor and used my biology background and lap training to become a certified hemodialysis technician. I've been at that profession for the past 4 years.</p>
		<p>After several years as a dialysis technician, the profession was no longer fulfilling. I felt as though I needed to pursue a field more in line with my interests as well as give me more of an intellectual challenge. That is where I am today. I am not partaking in a venture into to world of web development through the University of California, Los Angeles extension's web development bootcamp with hopes of using the knowledge that I learn through this course towards a career in technology.</p>
