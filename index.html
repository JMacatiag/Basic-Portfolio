					<p>I am a 28 year old male. Currently residing in California but I was born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States at the age of one in 1990. Upon finishing highechool I attended the University of Riverside, California under a biology major with plans to go pre-med to eventually be a forensic scientist. </p><br>
					<p>After several years as a dialysis technician, the profession was no longer fulfilling. I felt as though I needed to pursue a field more in line with my interests as well as give me more of an intellectual challenge. That is where I am today. I am not partaking in a venture into to world of web development through the University of California, Los Angeles extension's web development bootcamp with hopes of using the knowledge that I learn through this course towards a career in technology.</p><br>
